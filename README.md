# BMI-CALCULATOR
This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator implemented in Python. The BMI calculator takes a user's name, weight, and height as inputs, computes their BMI, and provides feedback based on the BMI value. It is designed to give users a quick assessment of their body weight status and offer basic health advice.
