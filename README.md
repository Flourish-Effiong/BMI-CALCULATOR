# BMI-CALCULATOR
This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator implemented in Python. The BMI calculator takes a user's name, weight, and height as inputs, computes their BMI, and provides feedback based on the BMI value. It is designed to give users a quick assessment of their body weight status and offer basic health advice. For a comprehensive health evaluation, please consult with a healthcare professional.

Features
•	User Input: The program prompts the user to enter their name, weight (in pounds), and height (in inches).

•	BMI Calculation: The BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = (weight in pounds x 703) / (height in inches x height in inches). This was obai ed from the website linked in the file.

•	Feedback: Based on the calculated BMI, the program provides feedback that classifies the user's weight status into categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, severely obese, and morbidly obese. Each category comes with a specific health advice message.

•	Validation: The program includes basic validation to ensure that the inputs are positive numbers.
